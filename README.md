# [GOOB (Get Out Of Bed)](https://goob.jupiterpi.de)

GOOB is an app that gets you out of bed quickly!

- Set **commitments** on goals, and you **can't take them back!**
- Complete them before their due date using the **completion key**, e. g. by **scanning a QR code** or **tapping an NFC tag** at a **physical location** (helps you get out of bed in record time!)
- All your failed commitments show up in **your friends'** timeline, where they can **scold you** for being bad, see it in your timeline and you **feel bad**

Also:
- Set goals for anything, and use any completion key (as long as it can open a link)
- Comment on why you failed or needed to cancel a commitment
- Share your completion keys with others (e. g. people in the same household using the same physical completion keys)

Roadmap: push notifications, QR code generator, helpful guides, prettier UI

Let me know what you think, and thanks for using GOOB ⭐
